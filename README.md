Private chat application in nodejs

I build my private chat application based on nodejs and socket.io. You can register and chat with people who are currently in server in a private room, not a broadcast chat. With flat and responsive design, it looks attractive and ease to use.
I just have learned about nodejs and built it in a short time so that it may contain many bugs.
I will improve it in my possible.

Here are some features:

1. Login by local and social
2. View people available to chat
3. Chat with another people.
4. Get user avatar in gavatar by email.
5. Flat design like iOS7 using Framework7
